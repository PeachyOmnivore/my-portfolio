                            <p>2023/2024: A full time 6 month, 1000+ hour coding bootcamp, where we worked on all skills necessary to become a full-stack developer, I gained a passion for learning and growing in my code quality and tool kit of skills. With a background in outdoor pursuits and management I have learned many valuable skills that honed my experience with team building and working together to achieve a common goal.</p>
                            <p>I enjoyed the experience of becoming a scrum master for a week and guiding my fellow collegues through some challenges on a team project we worked on. This I believe was a valuable skill in learning what working in an agile environment will be like.</p>
